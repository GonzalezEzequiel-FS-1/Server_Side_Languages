### Welcome to Week 2
---
This week we will integrate MongoDB into out process, seems really fun!
I created a new project, just so I could practice a bit more, I have a few ideas that could help to make the previous week's project a tiny bit better, I might integrate them in this one!


### TODOs
Just thought about a random team generator, maybe creating a function that provides 6 random numbers  from 1 to 151 and sending a query for api/pokedex?num=1&num=2 etc.
